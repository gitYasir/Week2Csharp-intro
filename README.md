This is a program we used to practice and get familiar with Visual Studio and C#. 
We wrote a basic hello world app and then moved on to writing and debugging for loops.

## Notes


## Questions:

### What is the difference between .NET Framework, NET Core, and .NET5/.NET6?
  - **.NET Framework:** The Dot Net Framework was designed to let developers construct programs that would operate on Microsoftâ€™s Windows platform and dot net framework applications are multi-platform applications.
  - **.NET Core:** It is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. It is a cross-platform successor to .NET Framework. 
  - **.NET5:** .NET 5 is the next major release of .NET Core. Lays foundations for other operating systems integration (eg iOS, Android).
  - **.NET6:** Delivers the final parts of the .NET unification plan that started with .NET 5. It simplifies development and improves performance and productivity.
